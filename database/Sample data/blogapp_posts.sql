Filled with virtuosic images of terrible deeds and violence, his movies entertain almost begrudgingly. Even when good somewhat triumphs, the victories come at a brutal cost. No one, Fincher warns, is going to save us. You will hurt and you will die, and sometimes your pretty wife’s severed head will end up in a box.</p><p>Long a specialized taste, Fincher in recent years started to feel like an endangered species: a commercial director who makes studio movies for adult audiences, in an industry in thrall to cartoons and comic books.

Welles was 25 when he began filming “Citizen Kane,” the most famous directorial debut in cinema history. There’s little to connect the men other than cinema. Welles had a background in radio and theater; Fincher had worked in postproduction before he started directing commercials and music videos. The Hollywood each man worked in was also different, though by the time Fincher made his first film for 20th Century Fox, the industry had weathered multiple existential threats beyond the coming of sound, including the end of the old studio system and the introduction of television and, later, home video.</p><p><br></p><p>By the time that Fincher was working on “Alien 3” (1992), the Hollywood that had warily welcomed and then turned on Welles was gone and the studios were part of multinational conglomerates.

Fincher had a tough time with Fox during “Alien 3,” and with many others involved in its creation, partly because it wasn’t his to control.

One of the most powerful tools you have at your disposal is word-of-mouth referrals. Not only are these referrals free, but they can also be incredibly effective in helping you reach more customers and grow your business. You can simply ask your customers to spread the word about your services or products. This type of marketing helps build brand recognition and loyalty among potential customers who may not have otherwise heard about your business. Furthermore, these people tend to have established relationships with your current customers. As a result, when someone recommends your business to their friend or family member, they become an extension of your business’s reputation and credibility. This type of recommendation is much more powerful than any advertising campaign or online review could be. </span></h3><h3><br></h3><h3><span style=\"background-color: var(--ricos-custom-p-background-color,unset);\">Word-of-mouth referrals are when someone recommends a product or service to their friends or family members. This type of referral is invaluable for businesses because it\'s an endorsement from someone that your potential customer knows and trusts. Plus, word-of-mouth referrals are free - there is no cost associated with them!</span></h3><h3><br></h3><h3><span style=\"background-color: var(--ricos-custom-p-background-color,unset);\">The best way to get word-of-mouth referrals is simply by providing excellent customer service. When people have a good experience with your product or service, they are much more likely to tell their friends about it.

It\'s bad, and it\'s getting worse. The main cause is burning fossil fuels, which spews CO2&nbsp;into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide, as we all know too well by now, is a greenhouse gas, meaning it absorbs heat radiation from the Earth, preventing it from escaping out into space.</h3><p><br></p><h3>A certain amount of this is good—without CO2&nbsp;the Earth would be so cold, the oceans would freeze. But in preindustrial times the concentration of CO2&nbsp;in the atmosphere was about 280 parts per million.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/carbon-dioxide-now-more-than-50-higher-than-pre-industrial-levels\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(26, 26, 26); background-color: transparent;\">Now it\'s 420 ppm, or 50 percent higher</a>. (You might be surprised to know that CO2&nbsp;is only 0.04 percent of the air we breathe, but that\'s enough to ruin everything.)</h3><h3><br></h3><h2><strong>Free Expansion of Gas</strong></h2><h3>Let\'s start with a simple example. Imagine we have a box with a volume of 1 cubic meter, and it has a divider that splits it into two equal halves. On one side it contains nitrogen at atmospheric pressure and temperature, and the other side is completely empty. Here\'s a diagram:</h3><h3><span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(26, 26, 26);\">We can model this gas as a bunch of tiny balls (molecules of nitrogen) bouncing around. When a nitrogen ball collides with a wall of the container, it gives it a tiny little push. All these pushes are what cause the gas to have a pressure. In this case, it’s a pressure of 1 atmosphere, or about 100,000 newtons per square meter. (One N/m2&nbsp;is also called a pascal).</span></h3><h3><br></h3><h2><strong>Separating Mixed Gases</strong></h2><h3>Here\'s the cool thing: We can use the same idea about changes in entropy when separating gases to estimate the energy requirement of removing CO2&nbsp;from the air. Instead of letting a gas expand into a larger volume, we want to take a mixture of two gases and move them to opposite sides of the container.</h3><h3>Just to show you what this would look like, suppose we have a red-ball gas mixed with a blue-ball gas. We could then use two magical moving walls. One wall lets only blue balls through, the other lets only red balls through. After moving these walls, we would have a gas separation.</h3><h3><br></h3><h2><strong>Carbon Dioxide Capture</strong></h2><h3>OK, now we have the physics of separating gases, so let\'s use it. How much energy would it take to pluck carbon dioxide molecules out of the air? This is a tough calculation, but let\'s start small with that 1 cubic meter of air. (For simplicity, let\'s again say it\'s mainly nitrogen.) At a room temperature of 293 K (68 Fahrenheit) and air pressure of 1 atmosphere, this would be 2.47 x 1025&nbsp;molecules. At 400 ppm, 9.89 x 1021&nbsp;of these will be carbon dioxide.

R&amp;D will continue to be expensed in companies’ financial reporting statements.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>How does R&amp;D capitalization work?</strong></h2><p>To better understand how R&amp;D capitalization works, let’s walk through an example. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2021, that $1.5 million of R&amp;D expenditures must be capitalized and amortized over five years (assuming expenses were incurred within the U.S.). This results in a $300,000 tax deduction against $1 million of tax revenue that would result in $700,000 in taxable income for the year. At a federal tax rate of 21%, that’s almost a $150,000 tax liability for the year.&nbsp;</p><p>In summary, this company brought in $1 million in revenue and expended $1.5 million. They lost money. And now in addition to that, they also owe almost $150,000 of tax liability due in April of the next year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As you can see, the changes to R&amp;D cost capitalization results in a phantom income increase. Amortization may cause companies in a loss situation to become taxable. Companies with large investments in R&amp;D and no taxable income may struggle to come up with funds to cover the income tax resulting from the TCJA change.&nbsp;</p><p>Federal tax law is an ever-changing beast.

Both brothers are set to return and direct Avengers 5 and 6 for the studio after already directing&nbsp;<em>Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Avengers: Endgame</em>. The crowd erupts, cheering, chanting the duo’s name as a mashup video featuring all their previous Marvel film’s best moments.</p><p><br></p><p>The duo came on stage with Feige to reveal&nbsp;Avengers: Secret Wars, which was one of the first comics they both loved as children and always wanted to adapt to as adults. After stepping away from Marvel Studios following Endgame, they are extremely excited to return for the next two films. They also revealed that the fifth Avengers film before Secret Wars must follow an extremely important villain not yet seen in the MCU. Before revealing <u>Avengers 5</u> (<em>previously titled The Kang Dynasty</em>) will now be titled&nbsp;Avengers: Doomsday. Marvel has long been rumored to move away from the character of Kang the Conquerer following the extremely poor reception of Ant-Man 3 and&nbsp;the firing of actor&nbsp;Jonathan Majors. And they will now focus on the Fantastic Four arch nemesis,&nbsp;Doctor Doom.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Finally</strong>, the duo revealed that they had already cast the role of&nbsp;Victor Von Doom, much to the surprise of the Hall H audience. Then, a group of cloaked figures in Doom masks appeared on stage, with one coming to the front of the group. He removes his mask to reveal that&nbsp;Robert Downey Jr.&nbsp;will be returning to star as Doctor Doom, not Tony Stark, in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. All 6,500+ attendees in Hall H erupted with this reveal at the panel. The character has long been butchered in live-action form after appearing in 2005’s and 2015’s Fantastic Four films (played by Julian McMahon &amp; Toby Kebbell respectively).&nbsp;Stephen McFeely&nbsp;is set to pen both Avengers films after Michael Waldron (Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness) &amp; Jeff Loveness (Ant-Man 3) wrote previous drafts. Screenwriter Christopher Markus will not work alongside his longtime writing partner.</p><p><br></p><p>We at&nbsp;Knight Edge Media&nbsp;had heard several months ago that concept art was floating around for the&nbsp;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&nbsp;post-credit scene that would set up <strong><em><u>Robert Downey Jr.</u></em></strong> as an alternate Doctor Doom in a bought Avengers Tower. However, this was never shot and ultimately cut in favor of the Hall H announcement and Avengers feature film. Finally, Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars logos and their release dates appeared on the screen to close out Hall H.</p><p><br></p><p>However, by far the biggest news to come out of the hour-long Hall H panel was the revelation that Robert Downey Jr. is returning to the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Doctor Doom!&nbsp;It sounds like he\'ll appear in both upcoming&nbsp;<em>Avengers</em>&nbsp;movies and, as expected, those will be directed by&nbsp;<strong><em>Avengers: Endgame</em></strong>&nbsp;helmers Joe and Anthony Russo. They\'ve steered Marvel Studios to huge success in the past so it makes perfect sense to trust them with the Multiverse Saga\'s two most important projects.</p><p>Joining them will be&nbsp;Stephen McFeely as the writer of both movies (for whatever reason, he won\'t be joined by Christopher Markus).&nbsp;</p><p>As for Downey, while he bid farewell to the MCU in 2019, this surprise return comes shortly after the actor won an Oscar for his work in&nbsp;<em>Oppenheimer</em>. It\'s unlikely we\'ll see his face as Doom and&nbsp;the comics have frequently hinted at some sort of familial connection between him, Iron Man, and Kang.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(64, 64, 64);\">Marvel Studios has also shared official title treatments for both&nbsp;</span><em style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(64, 64, 64);\">Avengers: Doomsday</em><span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(64, 64, 64);\">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><em style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(64, 64, 64);\">Avengers: Secret Wars</em><span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(64, 64, 64);\">.
